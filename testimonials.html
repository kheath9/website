                <p>When our first son was born with 6 fingers on his right hand, as parents we were naturally worried. What would the other dutchesses and dukes think? Could our baby boy ever grow up to play the lute?
                    Would he be an outcast or stuck in the life of a court jester or traveling vagabond? These thoughts and more raced through our minds as we held our boy.
                </p>
                
                <p>Thankfully, we were quickly introduced to Dalton Crumm through a dear friend at the torture center and they assured us that our dear Torvus would not only survive, but thrive. Dalton took our boy under his metaphorical
                    and literal wing (he has since had them surgically removed so he can better swing a katana) and taught our little Torv the ways of a TechDeck fingerboard. Within months we were the proud parents of the second-place 
                    finalist in the North Eastern Ohio Regional TechDeck Funngrrboard to End Hunnngrr sponsored by Tony Hawk conference!

                </p>
                
                <p>Since then, our boy Torvus Hinkle-Bruge has placed in every regional competition and is well on his way to stardom as well as a frightening level of political power and has impressed the young Mobile, AL influencer
                Prince Humperdick and has been added to his entourage.</p>
                
                <p>My wife and I still have no idea what the hell a 'bitcoin' is or where to get one.</p>

                <p>I attended one of Dalton's workshops at the I-75 rest top bewteen mile markers 142 and 143. What I learned there inspired me to merge the power of the blockchain with my beaded lizard keychain business.
                    After following Dalton's business enhancement templates, I now have over 12 views of my products on my digital shop each month and have sold nearly 3 blockchain-registered lizard keychains to satisfied customers who were looking to 
                    acquire a rapidly appreciating asset that is on the forefront of the latest trends in digital finance.
                </p>
                
                <p>I highly recommend anyone looking to enhance their business to connect with Dalton Crumm.</p>

                <p>I found out about Dalton after seeing his 'Breaking Barriers' presentation on the local access tv channel one night. At the time, I was wide awake with heartbearn because I had just drank one of those 'hot ones' sauce bottles
                    on a dare from my step son in an effort to connect with him. My effort failed to impress him and I was wallowing in regret. 
                </p>
                
                <p>Dalton's presentation was transformative to me. His showcase of both physical and mental prowess made me buy his E-book. Using the techniques within, I was able to work my way up to drinking three entire bottles
                    of hot sauce in one sitting, which finally impressed my step son and helped us grow closer. He has now stopped hitting me in the knees with a wiffle ball bat while I am leaving for work.
                </p>
                
                <p>I'm grateful for the opportunity to work with such a dedicated professional who genuinely cares about the success of his clients.</p>

                <p>As a struggling hand athlete, working with Dalton Crumm has been an amazing experience. His coaching have helped me achieve goals I thought were out of reach.</p>
                
                <p>I wanted to push the boundaries of the field and popularize tricks with tiny razor scooters. Dalton's coaching both solifified my understanding of fingersport fundamentals and worked with me to pioneer new techniques
                    in a short time frame. 
                </p>
                
                <p>I highly recommend Dalton to anyone looking to elevate their performance, whether in athletics, business, or personal development.</p>
